# Kepler Discovering - The spatial Game
## Game description
The purpose of the game is to try to dodge and not collide with the plants that appear in space. The game screen is an interface from which different types of planets and other elements will fall. The player is represented by an image of a rocket whose function is to dodge the planets.
The player's movement is horizontal, for this the left arrow and right arrow keys are used, but he always has to use the space key to activate the rocket propellant and be able to navigate. Otherwise gravity will cause it to fall.
The game does not have an ending, but adds the score until it collides with a planet.
